*Zoho 2nd Round Coding questions*

1. Given a text and a wildcard pattern, implement wildcard pattern matching algorithm that finds if wildcard pattern is matched with text. The matching should cover the entire text (not partial text). The wildcard pattern can include the characters ‘?’ and ‘*’
Question Mark Symbol – matches any single character
Star Symbol – Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence)

2. Given an input string and a dictionary of words, find out if the input string can be
segmented into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words. See following examples
for more details.

Consider the following dictionary
{ i, like, sam, sung, samsung, mobile, ice,
 cream, icecream, man, go, mango}
Input: ilike
Output: Yes
The string can be segmented as "i like".
Input: ilikesamsung
Output: Yes
The string can be segmented as "i like samsung"
or "i like sam sung".<>

10 9 8 7
 6 5 4
  3 2

4. Given an array as input, The condition is if the number is repeated you must add the
number and put the next index value to 0. If the number is 0 print it at the last.
Eg: arr[] = { 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 6, 6, 0, 8}
Output: 4 2 12 8 0 0 0 0 0 .


5. Print the given input string in ‘X’ format.
Note: The string length will be of odd length.


6.Two sorted arrays will be given. Create an array consisting of the elements of two arrays
with duplicate elements removed in sorted order.
Note: Use only one loop. No sorting.


7. Two strings of equal length will be given. Print all the adjacent pairs which are not
equal.
Input: asdfghij and adsfgijh
Output: sd-ds, hij-ijh


8. Find the frequency of all numbers in an array.
Note: use dynamic memory allocation.
For example, if the input is {1, 2, 45, 67, 1, 88}, do not calculate the frequency of all
elements from 1 to 88.


9.From the input sentence given, find the strings which are not palindrome and print it.
Input: he knows malayalam
Output: he knows


10. Given two Strings s1 and s2, remove all the characters from s1 which is present in s2.
Input: s1=”expErIence”, s2=”En”
output: s1=”exprIece”
